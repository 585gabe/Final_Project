#urllib.request is the library that allows us to get information from a website

#Aparently urlopen returns "bytes" but json wants "str" so . . .
decoded_result = encoded_result.decode("utf-8")

#Load the string into json so that is can be manipulated as such

#Most of the code is the example code from https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/
#All the rest is from google searches and stackexchange
